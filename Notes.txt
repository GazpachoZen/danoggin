--------------------

Splash Screen Image (danoggin_splash.png)
This is the logo that appears centered on the splash screen with the app name and loading indicator below it.

Dimensions: 512x512 pixels (1:1 aspect ratio)
Format: PNG with transparency
Content suggestions:

A simple, recognizable logo
Use the app's primary color scheme (purple tones)
Keep details minimal as it will be viewed briefly
Leave some padding around the edges



Welcome Image (danoggin_welcome.png)
This appears at the top of the role selection screen when the app is launched for the first time.

Dimensions: Approximately 600x400 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio)
Format: PNG with transparency
Content suggestions:

A welcoming, friendly illustration
Could show the app's purpose (perhaps showing a responder and observer)
More detailed than the splash logo
Should complement the "Welcome to Danoggin!" text that appears below it
