5. Update Your UI Components
You'll want to update various UI components to use your new color scheme. Here are a few examples:
For QuizPage:

dart// In quiz_page.dart, update the feedback colors

	if (feedback != null)
	  Text(
		feedback!,
		style: TextStyle(
		  fontSize: 20,
		  color: feedback == '✅ Correct!'
			  ? AppColors.success
			  : (feedback == '❌ Incorrect. Try again.'
				  ? AppColors.warning
				  : AppColors.error),
		),
	  ),
	  
For Buttons and UI Elements:

	dartElevatedButton(
	  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
		backgroundColor: isSelected ? AppColors.coral : AppColors.midBlue,
	  ),
	  onPressed: () { /* ... */ },
	  child: Text('Submit'),
	),

=====================
Attached are the source files for an app called Danoggin. It is a cognitive check-in application with two primary user roles: Responders and Observers. The app is designed to monitor cognitive awareness through regular quiz-like check-ins. Admin functionality for the related Firestore database and images is provided through a family of Python scripts. Below is an overview of some key points. Please examine the source files to the point of understanding them, but no summary is needed. Await further instruction.

Main roles...
- Responders: Users who answer periodic quiz questions
- Observers: Users who monitor responders' performance on check-ins

Main Functionality...
- Question-based check-ins with multiple-choice answers
- Scheduled notifications to prompt responders to complete check-ins
- Tracking of missed/incorrect responses
- Observer dashboard to monitor responder performance
- Relationship management between responders and observers

Architecture...
- Flutter-based mobile app with Firebase backend
- FireStore for data storage
- Firebase Cloud Storage for image assets
- Firebase Authentication for user management

Admin Tools...
- Python scripts for backend management
- Firebase management utilities

---------------------
I'm interested in making sure that some of the configuration settings for a responder do not get into a confusing state. Specifically, the timeout interval for responding to a question should never be more than half of the time between questions; it should also never be more than 15 minutes. Said another way, the time between questions can never be less than twice the time limit for answering a question. Can we somehow limit the behavior of the two input sliders accordingly? Discuss your approach before making any code change suggestions.
---------------------
Try all this with Tracy's phone.
---------------------
Make installers and see if that works.
---------------------
As this gets ready to roll out to the field, we'll need a way of managing version numbers. Any suggestions?
---------------------
---------------------
JEI - remember to turn kDevModeEnabled back to false wherever it exists.
---------------------
Danoggin should auto-start when phone powers up. Please discuss how this is accomplished before suggesting any code changes.
---------------------
---------------------
The app presently uses anonymous authentication for Firebase. We need to button that up before making this app generally available. I'm not very familiar with Firebase. What would be the necessary steps?
------------------------------------------ LATER...
Make a states and cities question pack. All the state capitals, etc.
---------------------
As a future capability, we'll eventually want the apps to notice that updates are available.

What's left to do (according to Claude)...

Version Management
	Version Numbering System
		Implement semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.1)
		Add version information to the app UI (probably in settings)
		Create a system to track database schema versions for Firebase
		Consider a minimum supported version mechanism

Technical Completeness
	Error Handling
		Comprehensive error logging and crash reporting
		Graceful degradation when network is unavailable
		User-friendly error messages for all failure cases
	Data Backup/Recovery
		Data migration strategy between versions
		Consider backup mechanisms for check-in data
		Document recovery procedures for admins
	Performance Optimization
		Check for memory leaks in long-running processes
		Optimize Firebase queries (especially with pagination)
		Test with large datasets

User Experience Polish
	Onboarding
		Better first-run experience
		Guided tour of features
		Clear instructions for each role
	Help & Documentation
		In-app help system
