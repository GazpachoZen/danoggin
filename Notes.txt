5. Update Your UI Components
You'll want to update various UI components to use your new color scheme. Here are a few examples:
For QuizPage:

dart// In quiz_page.dart, update the feedback colors

	if (feedback != null)
	  Text(
		feedback!,
		style: TextStyle(
		  fontSize: 20,
		  color: feedback == '✅ Correct!'
			  ? AppColors.success
			  : (feedback == '❌ Incorrect. Try again.'
				  ? AppColors.warning
				  : AppColors.error),
		),
	  ),
	  
For Buttons and UI Elements:

	dartElevatedButton(
	  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
		backgroundColor: isSelected ? AppColors.coral : AppColors.midBlue,
	  ),
	  onPressed: () { /* ... */ },
	  child: Text('Submit'),
	),


---------------------
I'm now interested in making sure that some of the configuration settings for a responder do not get into a confusing state. Specifically, the timeout interval for responding to a question should never be more than half of the time between questions; it should also never be more than 15 minutes. Said another way, the time between questions can never be less than twice the time limit for answering a question. Can we somehow limit the behavior of the two input sliders accordingly?

---------------------
Refactor the larger files (quiz_page.dart)

---------------------
As an administrator, I need a way to purge stale observers and responders from Firestore.

---------------------
---------------------
For questions that do not have images, the answers shown do not always fit comfortably within the bounds of the buttons on the display. For example... if possible answer is "Mexico City" it nicely breaks into two lines on the space. However, if the answer is "Washington D.C.", the line break happens between the "o" and the "n" in the word "Washington", creating an awkward display.

Is it possible to determine if the answer does not fit comfortably inside the button and adjust the font size as necessary to make it fit nicely? We should strive to keep the default font size as-is for answers that already fit. In other words, we go to smaller font sizes only when needed.

---------------------
Make it harder to accidentally terminate Danoggin. 

---------------------
Make Danoggin auto-start when phone powers up.

---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
Presently the danoggin app is hard-coded to use only the "demo_pack" set of questions. Eventually, there may be any number of possible question packs. Any particular "responder" will want to sign up for any number of the question packs. We will need a way to manage this selection process from the responder's settings page. How would you approach these code changes?
