5. Update Your UI Components
You'll want to update various UI components to use your new color scheme. Here are a few examples:
For QuizPage:

dart// In quiz_page.dart, update the feedback colors

	if (feedback != null)
	  Text(
		feedback!,
		style: TextStyle(
		  fontSize: 20,
		  color: feedback == '✅ Correct!'
			  ? AppColors.success
			  : (feedback == '❌ Incorrect. Try again.'
				  ? AppColors.warning
				  : AppColors.error),
		),
	  ),
	  
For Buttons and UI Elements:

	dartElevatedButton(
	  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
		backgroundColor: isSelected ? AppColors.coral : AppColors.midBlue,
	  ),
	  onPressed: () { /* ... */ },
	  child: Text('Submit'),
	),

=====================
Attached are the source files for an app called Danoggin. It is a cognitive check-in application with two primary user roles: Responders and Observers. The app is designed to monitor cognitive awareness through regular quiz-like check-ins. Admin functionality for the related Firestore database and images is provided through a family of Pythn scripts which will be provided separately if needed. Below is an overview of some key points. Please examine the source files then await further instruction.

Main roles...
- Responders: Users who answer periodic quiz questions
- Observers: Users who monitor responders' performance on check-ins

Main Functionality...
- Question-based check-ins with multiple-choice answers
- Scheduled notifications to prompt responders to complete check-ins
- Tracking of missed/incorrect responses
- Observer dashboard to monitor responder performance
- Relationship management between responders and observers

Architecture...
- Flutter-based mobile app with Firebase backend
- FireStore for data storage
- Firebase Cloud Storage for image assets
- Firebase Authentication for user management

Admin Tools...
- Python scripts for backend management
- Firebase management utilities

---------------------
I'm interested in making sure that some of the configuration settings for a responder do not get into a confusing state. Specifically, the timeout interval for responding to a question should never be more than half of the time between questions; it should also never be more than 15 minutes. Said another way, the time between questions can never be less than twice the time limit for answering a question. Can we somehow limit the behavior of the two input sliders accordingly?
---------------------
Try all this with Tracy's phone.
---------------------
Make installers and see if that works.
---------------------
As this gets ready to roll out to the field, we'll need a way of managing version numbers. Any suggestions?
---------------------
For the Python admin tool, we need to have a means of purging the responder_status informaton. We should highlight the entries that have no corresponding entry in the users area, as well as somehow showing how man checkins happened and when the most recent one was. Along these line, the admin ability to get rid of users should also help do housecleaning here.
---------------------
JEI - remember to turn kDevModeEnabled back to false wherever it exists.
---------------------
Danoggin should auto-start when phone powers up. Please discuss how this is accomplished before suggesting any code changes.
---------------------
---------------------
The app presently uses anonymous authentication for Firebase. We need to button that up before making this app generally available. I'm not very familiar with Firebase. What would be the necessary steps?
------------------------------------------ LATER...
Make a states and cities question pack. All the state capitals, etc.
---------------------
As a future capability, we'll eventually want the apps to notice that updates are available.
