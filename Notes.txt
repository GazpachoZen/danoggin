5. Update Your UI Components
You'll want to update various UI components to use your new color scheme. Here are a few examples:
For QuizPage:

dart// In quiz_page.dart, update the feedback colors

	if (feedback != null)
	  Text(
		feedback!,
		style: TextStyle(
		  fontSize: 20,
		  color: feedback == '✅ Correct!'
			  ? AppColors.success
			  : (feedback == '❌ Incorrect. Try again.'
				  ? AppColors.warning
				  : AppColors.error),
		),
	  ),
	  
For Buttons and UI Elements:

	dartElevatedButton(
	  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
		backgroundColor: isSelected ? AppColors.coral : AppColors.midBlue,
	  ),
	  onPressed: () { /* ... */ },
	  child: Text('Submit'),
	),


---------------------
I'm now interested in making sure that some of the configuration settings for a responder do not get into a confusing state. Specifically, the timeout interval for responding to a question should never be more than half of the time between questions; it should also never be more than 15 minutes. Said another way, the time between questions can never be less than twice the time limit for answering a question. Can we somehow limit the behavior of the two input sliders accordingly?

---------------------
Refactor the larger files (quiz_page.dart)

---------------------
As an administrator, I need a way to purge stale observers and responders from Firestore.

---------------------
---------------------
Sometimes the text doesn't fit the buttons. Change font size for that one button as needed. (Washington, D.C. vs Mexico City - the first breaks uncomfortably, the 2nd doesn't)

---------------------
Make it harder to accidentally terminate Danoggin. 

---------------------
Make Danoggin auto-start when phone powers up.

Questions in the demo_pack still have newly_uploaded flag
