================================================================================
================================================================================
================================================================================ Getting started...
Please review the contents in the project knowledge to the point where you understand what the Danoggin project is about and how it operates. Pay particular attention to the Foundation.txt file. Do not provide a summary. Await further instruction.

I welcome modifications that might require multiple steps, understanding that these are sometimes warranted. When that happens, I prefer that you show them to me one file at a time. I do NOT want a blitz of file modifications to be shown as a single output from you. 
================================================================================ 
---------------------
I'd like us to review and re-think how we handle non-activity from the responder.
---------------------
I'd like to be more judicious about what exactly is getting archived away with Git, especially as it pertains to what makes its way up to GitHub. 
---------------------
When an observer starts up for the very first time they are given minimal instructions about how to link to a main user. Expand this page a bit.
---------------------
Smaller fonts for the change log
---------------------
Over the course of a long development/debug cycle some of our source files have gotten out of hand. Please look at what I've provided and make some suggestions regarding refactoring. If things are fine as-is, that's okay too.
---------------------
The app presently uses anonymous authentication for Firebase. We should probably button that up before making this app generally available. I'm not very familiar with Firebase. What would be the necessary steps?
---------------------
Can we create a mechanism to pause/cancel notifications for responder somehow? I could see the need to temporarily halt them once in a while. It should probably be near the top of the responder's settings page. If a responder has opted to pause the check-in notifications, then we should probably notify their observers, and also somehow take that into account with respect to the inactivity notification. Please discuss before making any code change suggestions.
---------------------
Seek and destroy all deprecated method calls. Check logs to help find them. Specifically, check settings_page.dart
Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
---------------------
I notice that the icon for the app has a white circle around the main graphic. How would I make that a different color?
---------------------
I would like to provide a beta release to both Android and iOS users shortly. Please identify things which might need to be addressed before we do this.
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
================================================================================ Do these periodically...
Please examine the pubspec.yaml file I provided you. As a rule, I prefer stability over having the latest version of things. With that in mind, am I using the best versions of the various packages to get equal functionality for Android and iOS? I sometimes feel like I'm not getting the best development options. Is there any other information you might need from my development environment to answer this question?
---------------------
Attached is the output from "flutter run"? Is there anything here you find troubling?
---------------------
In the anasysis_options.yaml file, start selectively commenting off some of the errors we're currently ignoring and decide if they are things we really want to worry about.
	analyzer:
	  errors:
		# deprecated_member_use: error <<<========= Big one to chase some day soon!
		prefer_const_constructors: ignore
		prefer_adjacent_string_concatenation: ignore
		use_super_parameters: ignore
		use_build_context_synchronously: ignore
		library_private_types_in_public_api: ignore
---------------------
================================================================================ Question packs...
Make a states and cities question pack. All the state capitals, etc.
Major cities in all 50 states. Maybe 2-3 cites per state, if warranted.
Colored words, where we have words presented as graphics, but in colors other than what they say.
Colored shapes (red-triangle, blue square) incorrect answers will always include a similar shape, and a similar color
================================================================================ LATER...
Remember to turn kDevModeEnabled back to false wherever it exists.
---------------------
As a future capability, we'll eventually want the apps to notice that updates are available.
---------------------
Danoggin should auto-start when phone powers up. Please discuss how this is accomplished before suggesting any code changes.
---------------------
It would be nice to have a mechanism for an observer to somehow coerce a related responder's app to present a question.
---------------------
We'll eventually need a way to purge the database of users that have ghosted the app. 
---------------------
We should have a fremium capability for main-user/support-partner teams to make their own question packs
---------------------
---------------------
---------------------
================================================================================
