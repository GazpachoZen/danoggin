## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Build Problems and Fixes

### 1. **Kotlin or AndroidX Errors**
```
Unresolved reference: FlutterActivity
Cannot access ComponentActivityViewModelLazy
```
**Fix:** Ensure `compileSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and Kotlin version are correctly set (see config above).

---

### 2. **Gradle 7.6 or Version Mismatch Errors**
```
Minimum supported Gradle version is 8.0. Current version is 7.6
```
**Fix:** Update `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:
```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.4-all.zip
```

---

### 3. **Java Version Problems**
```
Failed to load JDK image
or
Source/target value 17 is not supported
```
**Fix:**
- Make sure Java 17 is installed (Eclipse Adoptium JDK 17 recommended)
- Set `JAVA_HOME` to the Java 17 path
- Keep `sourceCompatibility` / `targetCompatibility` as `VERSION_1_8` for best Flutter plugin compatibility

---

### 4. **Daemon or Cache Corruption**
```
Cannot delete build folder
Old Gradle daemon keeps starting with Java 21
```
**Fix:**
- Kill all `java.exe`, `dart.exe`, `gradle` processes via Task Manager
- Delete:
  - `.gradle/` folders in project root and `android/`
  - `build/` folders in root and `android/`
  - Flutter cache: `flutter clean`

---

### 5. **`MainActivity.kt` Errors**
```
Unresolved reference: flutter_embedding_android
```
**Fix:**
Ensure `MainActivity.kt` looks like this:
```kotlin
package com.blue_vistas.danoggin

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {}
```

---

## üõ† Commands You‚Äôll Use Often
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --verbose
flutter run
```

---

## üßº Recommended Cleanup (Full Reset)
1. Close VS Code and all related processes
2. Delete:
   - `.gradle/`
   - `.dart_tool/`
   - `build/`
3. Remove older Gradle caches in `C:\Users\<user>\.gradle\wrapper\dists`
4. Reboot if Java version still seems incorrect

---

## üìå Tips
- Never mix direct Gradle CLI calls (`gradle build`) with Flutter's wrapper (`flutter build`) ‚Äî always let Flutter drive the toolchain
- Java 17 may be your system default, but Gradle plugins usually expect your `build.gradle` settings to declare compatibility explicitly

---

## üß≠ When In Doubt
If all else fails, re-run the following:
```bash
flutter doctor -v
flutter clean && flutter pub get
flutter build apk --verbose
```
And inspect logs near the **first error line** for root causes.
