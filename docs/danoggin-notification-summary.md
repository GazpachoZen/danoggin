# Project Status Summary: Danoggin Notification System

## Current Status

We have successfully refactored Danoggin's notification system from a monolithic implementation to a modular, extensible architecture. The new system includes:

1. **Layered Architecture**:
   - Clear separation between interfaces, implementation, and platform-specific code
   - Central manager (`NotificationManager`) as a facade for all notification functionality
   - Specialized components (logging, display, platform helpers) with single responsibilities

2. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   lib/services/notifications/
     ├── base/
     │   ├── notification_service.dart      # Core interface
     │   ├── notification_handler.dart      # Event handling interface
     │   └── notification_logger.dart       # Logging functionality
     ├── local/
     │   ├── local_notification_service.dart # Flutter local notifications
     │   ├── display_helper.dart           # Custom in-app notifications
     │   └── platform_helper.dart          # Platform-specific code
     └── notification_manager.dart         # Main facade
   ```

3. **Key Functionality**:
   - Cross-platform notifications (Android and iOS)
   - Custom in-app notifications for iOS foreground state
   - Multiple approaches for iOS background notifications
   - Lifecycle and context awareness
   - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Problem Statement

Despite our best efforts, iOS background notifications remain unreliable using local notifications. This is a fundamental limitation of iOS, which restricts apps from generating local notifications when in the background as a privacy/battery measure.

This limitation severely impacts Danoggin's core functionality, as:
1. Observers need to be notified of missed or incorrect check-ins
2. Responders need timely prompts to complete check-ins
3. Neither user type should need to actively monitor the app

## Proposed Solution: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

To resolve this limitation, we will implement Firebase Cloud Messaging, which uses Apple's Push Notification service (APNs) for iOS. This is the industry-standard approach for reliable background notifications because:

1. Push notifications originate from a trusted server, not the app itself
2. They can wake up an app even when it's completely inactive
3. They are delivered immediately without platform restrictions
4. They work consistently across both Android and iOS

## Implementation Plan

1. **FCM Integration**:
   - Add Firebase Cloud Messaging packages to the Flutter app
   - Implement FCM token generation and Firestore storage
   - Create notification handlers for all app states

2. **Server-Side Components**:
   - Set up Firebase Cloud Functions for notification triggers
   - Implement functions for:
     - Scheduled check-in prompts for responders
     - Missed/incorrect check-in alerts for observers
     - Test notifications for development
     - Observer-initiated check-ins (future feature)

3. **Client-Side Integration**:
   - Extend the notification architecture to include FCM support
   - Implement proper notification routing based on type and state
   - Handle foreground and background message processing

## Key Constraints and Considerations

1. **iOS Certification Requirements**:
   - Must obtain APNs authentication key
   - Need proper app capabilities in provisioning profile
   - Cannot use advanced notification features without special permissions

2. **Notification Types to Support**:
   - Scheduled responder check-ins
   - Alerts for missed/incorrect responses
   - Testing notifications for development
   - Future: Observer-initiated check-ins

3. **Testing Considerations**:
   - FCM notifications require server interaction
   - Need a reliable way to test in development
   - Must verify behavior in all app states

4. **Build System Integration**:
   - Must work with Codemagic for iOS builds
   - Need to ensure proper certificates and provisioning

## Next Steps

1. Add FCM packages and configure Firebase project
2. Create FCM service implementation
3. Set up Cloud Functions for notification triggers
4. Integrate with existing architecture
5. Test across platforms and app states

This solution will provide reliable notifications across all platforms and app states, resolving the critical issue with iOS background notifications and enabling Danoggin to function as intended.
